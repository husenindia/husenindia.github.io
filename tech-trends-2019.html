                        <p>According to one study, the extended reality (XR) market is forecast to grow to more than $209 billion in the next four years, an 800% increase from their 2018 prediction of $27 billion. Whatever the true figure, it is beyond doubt that this technology is set to revolutionize industries across the world, with more verticals than ever seeking to drive business growth by leveraging its potential benefits.</p>
                        <p>With a solution-driven agenda focused on enhancing the consumer experience of XR and driving its adoption, the VRX Conference & Expo 2019 will return to San Francisco, taking place December 12-13 at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco Airport Hotel. Key virtual and augmented/mixed reality stakeholders will share the visions, challenges and solutions they have encountered, discussing how XR can boost ROI, propel their business forward and engage consumers through immersive, innovative experiences. More than 600 attendees from across 10+ enterprise and consumer verticals, will join a senior speaker line-up focused on filtering through the hype around VR, AR and immersive tech. The VRX Conference & Expo 2019 speaker line-up includes senior executives from HTC Vive, ExxonMobil, DreamWorks, Paramount Pictures, HP, Survios, Nestlé, Bayer Pharma USA and others.</p>
                        <p>The agenda will cover both enterprise and consumer XR, including AEC, automotive, manufacturing, retail, healthcare, gaming, film, TV and beyond, with the underlying aim to go beyond the hype of XR to understand what are the keys to mass adoption and apply cross-industry knowledge to boost business productivity.</p>
                        <p>
