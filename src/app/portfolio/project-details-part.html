  <h1>Vehicle Parts Management System</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">UX & UI Case Study · Tablet-Based Warehouse Solution</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The Vehicle Parts Management System is a tablet-based warehouse application
    designed to help automotive warehouse staff efficiently manage inventory,
    part movement, storage, and supply operations.
  </p>
  <p>
    The system provides real-time visibility into parts stock, guides staff on
    where to store or retrieve parts, tracks the complete lifecycle of each part,
    and enables data-driven decisions through dashboards and reports.

    <li><strong>Role:</strong> Senior UX & UI Designer</li>
    <li><strong>Platform:</strong> Tablet Application</li>
    <li><strong>Users:</strong> Warehouse Staff, Inventory Managers</li>
    <li><strong>Industry:</strong> Automotive</li>
    <li><strong>Ownership:</strong> End-to-End UX & UI</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Problem</h2>
  <p>
    Vehicle parts warehouses often rely on manual processes, spreadsheets,
    and disconnected systems to manage inventory.
    This leads to misplaced parts, inaccurate stock levels,
    delayed service station deliveries, and inefficient use of warehouse space.
  </p>
  <p>
    Managing large and irregularly sized parts further increases complexity,
    making it difficult for warehouse staff to know where to store or retrieve items
    quickly and accurately.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Design Goal</h2>
  <p>
    Design a <strong>tablet-first inventory management system</strong> that enables
    warehouse staff to accurately track parts movement, optimize storage space,
    prevent stock shortages, and gain real-time operational insights.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>My Role</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Worked with stakeholders to understand warehouse operations and constraints</li>
    <li>Mapped end-to-end inventory and parts movement workflows</li>
    <li>Designed task-focused tablet interactions for warehouse staff</li>
    <li>Created UX flows for storage guidance, picking, and tracking</li>
    <li>Led usability reviews and iterative UI improvements</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>UX Strategy</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Task-driven design:</strong> Optimized for quick actions on the warehouse floor</li>
    <li><strong>Guided workflows:</strong> Tablet guides staff where to store or pick parts</li>
    <li><strong>Real-time accuracy:</strong> Instant updates for incoming and outgoing parts</li>
    <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Designed for small and large warehouses</li>
    <li><strong>Data visibility:</strong> Dashboards and reports for informed decisions</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Key User Flow</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>New parts arrive at the warehouse</li>
    <li>Warehouse staff logs parts using tablet</li>
    <li>System suggests optimal storage location based on size and availability</li>
    <li>Parts are stored and location is digitally recorded</li>
    <li>Parts are picked and dispatched to service stations when required</li>
    <li>Complete order-to-delivery status is tracked</li>
    <li>Stock levels are continuously updated</li>
  </ol>
</section>


<section>
  <h2>Inventory Tracking & Reporting</h2>
  <p>
    The system tracks each part from order placement to final delivery,
    providing complete traceability.
    Warehouse managers can access detailed reports on stock levels,
    usage patterns, and historical trends.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Alerts & Smart Recommendations</h2>
  <p>
    Automated alerts notify staff when stock levels fall below defined thresholds.
    The system recommends reordering parts directly from manufacturers,
    allowing warehouse teams to initiate procurement directly from the tablet.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Additional Challenge 1: Part Scanning & Location Accuracy</h2>
  <p>
    Warehouse staff handle a high volume of parts arriving from manufacturers
    and being dispatched to service stations throughout the day.
    Manually identifying parts and their storage or pickup locations
    increased the risk of misplacement, incorrect dispatch,
    and inventory inaccuracies.
  </p>
  <p>
    Staff needed a fast, reliable way to identify parts and receive
    clear guidance on <strong>where to store</strong> or
    <strong>where to collect</strong> each part without relying on memory
    or external documentation.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Solution</h2>
  <p>
    A tablet-based part scanning workflow was introduced to ensure
    accuracy and speed during inbound and outbound part handling.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Warehouse staff scan parts when receiving them from the manufacturer</li>
    <li>The system automatically identifies the part and its attributes</li>
    <li>The tablet guides staff to the correct storage location based on size and availability</li>
    <li>The system directs staff to the correct pickup location for that specific order</li>
    <li>When dispatching parts to service centers, staff scan parts again</li>
    <li>Inventory and order status are updated in real time</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This guided scanning approach reduced manual errors,
    improved inventory accuracy, and ensured that parts
    were consistently stored and retrieved from the correct locations.
  </p>
</section>


<section>
  <h2>Additional Challenge 2: Multi-Order Parts Fulfillment</h2>
  <p>
    Service stations place multiple parts orders throughout the day,
    and each order can contain a list of several different parts.
    Managing these concurrent orders manually increased the risk of
    incorrect picking, partial fulfillment, and delayed deliveries.
  </p>
  <p>
    Warehouse staff needed a clear way to understand
    <strong>which parts belonged to which order</strong>
    while handling high volumes under time pressure.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Solution</h2>
  <p>
    The system groups parts automatically by order,
    creating a clear, order-based fulfillment workflow for warehouse staff.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Each service station order is visually grouped within the tablet interface</li>
    <li>All parts required for an order are listed together with quantities</li>
    <li>Picking status is tracked at both part-level and order-level</li>
    <li>Orders move through clear states: Pending → Picking → Ready → Dispatched</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This approach reduced cognitive load for warehouse staff,
    minimized picking errors, and ensured complete and accurate
    order fulfillment before dispatch.
  </p>
</section>


<section>
  <h2>Outcome</h2>
  <p>
    The Vehicle Parts Management System significantly improved inventory accuracy,
    reduced part misplacement, and optimized warehouse space utilization.
  </p>
  <p>
    By digitizing storage guidance, tracking, and reordering,
    the solution streamlined warehouse operations and improved
    service station readiness.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
  <p>
    Designing for warehouse environments requires a strong focus on clarity,
    speed, and error prevention.
    Tablet-first, guided workflows proved highly effective in reducing
    cognitive load and operational mistakes in high-volume inventory systems.
