  <p class="subtitle">UX & UI Case Study</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    A post-COVID, end-to-end digital car service application designed for a UK-based automotive client.
    The product enables customers to book, manage, and complete their entire car service journey
    without physical human interaction, while maintaining transparency, trust, and flexibility.
  </p>
  <p>
    The application supports both <strong>self-service customers</strong> and
    <strong>service call-center employees</strong>, and is designed to scale across
    <strong>mobile, tablet, and desktop platforms</strong>.

  <h2>Problem</h2>
  <p>
    Traditional car service journeys relied heavily on phone calls, physical visits,
    and manual coordination between customers and service centers.
    Post-COVID, these processes no longer met user expectations for safety,
    convenience, and transparency.
  </p>
  <p>
    Customers lacked visibility into service progress, cost breakdowns,
    and vehicle handling, while service centers struggled to manage
    high call volumes and operational inefficiencies.

    <li><strong>Contactless by default:</strong> No mandatory physical interaction at any stage</li>
    <li><strong>Progressive disclosure:</strong> Present information step-by-step to reduce cognitive load</li>
    <li><strong>Automation over manual input:</strong> Vehicle data auto-fetched using registration number</li>
    <li><strong>Transparency & trust:</strong> Continuous visibility of service status and cost</li>
    <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Support for pickup/drop, rental vehicles, and assisted bookings</li>
  </ul>

    that empowered customers with control and transparency while reducing
    operational load on service centers.
