  <h1>Contract Management Platform</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">UX & UI Case Study · SaaS Product</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The Contract Management Platform is a generic SaaS solution designed
    for companies that lease, rent, or subscribe vehicles to customers.
    The product acts as a centralized system to manage vehicle contracts,
    terms, invoicing, and contract lifecycle changes between companies
    and their customers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Built as a flexible and configurable platform, the solution can be
    adopted by different organizations regardless of their business size
    or contract models.

  <h2>Problem</h2>
  <p>
    Companies managing vehicle leasing, renting, or subscriptions often rely on
    fragmented tools to handle contracts, invoices, and customer communication.
    This results in inconsistent contract data, manual invoicing,
    poor visibility into payment status, and limited flexibility
    when contract terms change.
  </p>
  <p>
    Customers also lack a clear, transparent way to view their contract details,
    track invoices, or request changes during the contract lifecycle.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Design Goal</h2>
  <p>
    Design a <strong>generic, scalable contract management system</strong>
    that standardizes agreements between companies and customers,
    supports flexible contract terms, automates invoicing,
    and simplifies contract lifecycle management.
