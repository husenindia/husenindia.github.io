  <h1>Broker Management Platform</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">UX & UI Case Study · Enterprise SaaS Product</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The Broker Management Platform is an enterprise SaaS solution designed
    to manage large-scale vehicle brokers who lease vehicles to end customers
    through leasing, renting, or subscription models.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unlike direct customer leasing, vehicles in this system are owned or leased
    by brokers. The platform acts as a centralized layer that tracks broker-owned
    vehicles, customer contracts, financials, and operational data throughout
    the vehicle lifecycle.

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Problem</h2>
  <p>
    Managing broker-owned vehicles at scale is operationally complex.
    Brokers supply vehicles that are further leased or rented to customers,
    creating multiple layers of ownership, contracts, and financial responsibility.
  </p>
  <p>
    Existing processes relied on fragmented systems to track brokers, vehicles,
    customer contracts, invoices, and documentation—making it difficult to
    maintain accurate records, trace vehicle usage, and manage financial workflows.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Design Goal</h2>
  <p>
    Design a <strong>centralized broker management system</strong> that enables
    companies to track broker vehicles, customer contracts, financial transactions,
    and operational history in one scalable, transparent platform.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>Broker & Vehicle Management</h2>
  <p>
    The platform allows internal teams to maintain a complete record of
    broker profiles and their associated vehicle fleets.
    Each vehicle is linked to broker ownership while remaining traceable
    across customer contracts and service history.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Quotes, Orders & Contract Tracking</h2>
  <p>
    All customer interactions—from initial quotes and proposals
    to finalized orders—are tracked within the system.
    This ensures a consistent audit trail and seamless transition
    between sales, operations, and finance teams.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Financials, Documentation & History</h2>
  <p>
    The system centralizes critical financial and operational data,
    including invoices, funding details, contractual documents,
    and vehicle service records.
  </p>
  <p>
    This enables accurate reporting, compliance readiness,
    and long-term visibility into broker and customer performance.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Outcome</h2>
  <p>
    The Broker Management Platform transformed a complex,
    multi-party vehicle operation into a structured, scalable system.
  </p>
  <p>
    By unifying broker data, customer contracts, financials,
    and vehicle history, the platform reduced operational friction
    and improved transparency across teams.
