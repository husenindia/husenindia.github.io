  <h1>Lease / Rent / Subscribe Car Platform</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">UX & UI Case Study · Fully Responsive Website</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The Lease / Rent / Subscribe Car platform is a fully responsive web experience
    designed to simplify how users discover, customize, and acquire vehicles
    through flexible ownership models.
  </p>
  <p>
    The platform enables users to seamlessly browse vehicles, personalize configurations,
    choose contract terms, and complete orders online, while managing their vehicles,
    subscriptions, and ownership lifecycle through a dedicated account dashboard.

    <li><strong>Role:</strong> Lead UX & UI Designer</li>
    <li><strong>Platform:</strong> Responsive Website (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile)</li>
    <li><strong>Industry:</strong> Automotive / Mobility</li>
    <li><strong>Ownership:</strong> End-to-End UX & UI</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Problem</h2>
  <p>
    Traditional vehicle leasing and rental journeys are often fragmented,
    difficult to compare, and heavily dependent on offline interactions.
    Users struggle to understand pricing, contract flexibility, and vehicle
    customization options across rent, lease, and subscription models.
  </p>
  <p>
    Post-purchase vehicle management—such as tracking service history,
    managing part exchanges, or reviewing previous vehicles—is rarely
    centralized in a single, intuitive digital experience.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Design Goal</h2>
  <p>
    Design a <strong>simple, transparent, and flexible digital platform</strong>
    that allows users to rent, lease, or subscribe to vehicles entirely online,
    while supporting long-term vehicle ownership tasks such as
    service tracking, part exchange, and contract management.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>My Role</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Collaborated with product owners and stakeholders to define business goals</li>
    <li>Designed end-to-end journeys for rent, lease, subscription, and post-order flows</li>
    <li>Created responsive interaction patterns across desktop, tablet, and mobile</li>
    <li>Defined vehicle customization, contract selection, and account management UX</li>
    <li>Led usability reviews and iterative UI improvements</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>UX Strategy</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Simple discovery:</strong> Filter vehicles by make, model, and body type</li>
    <li><strong>Guided customization:</strong> Step-by-step vehicle configuration with live pricing</li>
    <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Clear contract length, mileage, and cost breakdown</li>
    <li><strong>Lifecycle thinking:</strong> Support users beyond booking through My Account</li>
    <li><strong>Responsive-first:</strong> Consistent experience across all devices</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Key User Flow</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Select Rent, Lease, or Subscribe option</li>
    <li>Browse vehicles by make, model, or body type</li>
    <li>View vehicle details and pricing options</li>
    <li>Customize vehicle (wheels, paint, seats, trim, interior & exterior features)</li>
    <li>Select contract length and mileage</li>
    <li>Order vehicle online</li>
    <li>Manage vehicle, contracts, and services via My Account</li>
  </ol>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Vehicle Customization Experience</h2>
  <p>
    The customization flow enables users to personalize their selected vehicle
    while maintaining clarity around cost and contract impact.
    Real-time updates help users confidently evaluate trade-offs
    before committing to a long-term agreement.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>My Account Experience</h2>
  <p>
    The My Account section acts as a central hub for managing the entire
    vehicle lifecycle, from discovery to ongoing usage and future decisions.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Save favorite vehicles for comparison and future reference</li>
    <li>View active and past rental, lease, and subscription history</li>
    <li>Access complete service history for each vehicle</li>
    <li>Initiate and track part exchange requests for existing vehicles</li>
    <li>Submit online damage reports with images and descriptions</li>
    <li>Review contracts, invoices, and important documents</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Outcome</h2>
  <p>
    The final solution delivered a cohesive and scalable digital platform
    that supported both vehicle acquisition and long-term ownership needs.
  </p>
  <p>
    By integrating service history and part exchange into My Account,
    the platform increased customer retention and positioned the product
    as a long-term mobility companion rather than a one-time transaction.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
  <p>
    Designing for vehicle leasing and subscriptions requires a lifecycle mindset.
    Supporting users beyond the initial booking—through service history,
    part exchange, and account management—significantly improves trust,
    retention, and overall product value.
