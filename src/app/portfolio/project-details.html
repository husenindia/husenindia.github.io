  <h1>Smart Planner</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">UX & UI Flow Design Case Study</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Smart Planner is an operational planning and service management application designed
    to streamline appointment booking, mechanic allocation, and service execution
    across dealerships and service centers.
  </p>
  <p>
    The system supports real-time booking during live customer calls, automatic mechanic
    assignment, and end-to-end service tracking — from appointment creation to
    digital payment.

    <li><strong>Role:</strong> Lead UX & UI Designer</li>
    <li><strong>Platform:</strong> Desktop, Tablet</li>
    <li><strong>Users:</strong> Call Center Executives, Mechanics, Operations Team</li>
    <li><strong>Ownership:</strong> UX Flow Design & UI Strategy</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Problem</h2>
  <p>
    Booking service appointments during live customer calls was time-consuming and error-prone.
    Call center executives lacked a real-time view of mechanic availability, while mechanics
    had limited visibility into assigned work and service history.
  </p>
  <p>
    The absence of a unified system resulted in overbooking, inefficient mechanic utilization,
    delayed service updates, and fragmented customer experiences.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Design Goal</h2>
  <p>
    Design a centralized planner that enables <strong>fast appointment booking</strong>,
    <strong>automatic mechanic allocation</strong>, and <strong>real-time service execution</strong>,
    while providing clear visibility to both call center staff and mechanics.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>My Role</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Defined end-to-end user flows for booking, planning, and service execution</li>
    <li>Collaborated with stakeholders to align operational and UX requirements</li>
    <li>Designed planner interactions and mechanic workflows</li>
    <li>Created scalable UX patterns for internal tools</li>
    <li>Validated flows through usability reviews and iterations</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>UX Strategy</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Speed-first design:</strong> Optimized for live customer call scenarios</li>
    <li><strong>Calendar-driven planning:</strong> Day, week, and month visibility</li>
    <li><strong>Automation:</strong> Automatic mechanic assignment to reduce manual decisions</li>
    <li><strong>Role-based experiences:</strong> Distinct flows for call center and mechanics</li>
    <li><strong>Operational transparency:</strong> Real-time updates across the system</li>
  </ul>

<section>
  <h2>Key User Flow</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Receive customer call and initiate appointment booking</li>
    <li>Select dealership and service center</li>
    <li>View planner by day, week, or month</li>
    <li>Check mechanic-wise availability</li>
    <li>Identify the fastest available service slot</li>
    <li>Automatically assign the mechanic</li>
    <li>Create a work order linked to the assigned mechanic</li>
    <li>Mechanic views assigned job on tablet dashboard</li>
    <li>Mechanic uploads images, videos, damage reports, or adds services</li>
    <li>Track complete service history of the vehicle</li>
    <li>Complete service with digital payment</li>
  </ol>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Mechanic Experience</h2>
  <p>
    Mechanics access a dedicated tablet dashboard where they can view assigned vehicles,
    understand service requirements, upload service media, report damages,
    and suggest additional services in real time.
  </p>
  <p>
    This reduced dependency on verbal communication and improved accuracy
    in service documentation.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Outcome</h2>
  <p>
    Smart Planner enabled faster appointment booking during live calls,
    improved mechanic utilization, and created a seamless flow between
    planning, execution, and payment.
  </p>
  <p>
    The system unified multiple operational touchpoints into a single,
    transparent experience for call center teams and mechanics.

  <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
  <p>
    Designing internal operational tools requires prioritizing speed,
    clarity, and automation over visual complexity.
    Role-based workflows and real-time data visibility proved critical
    for reducing friction and improving service efficiency.
